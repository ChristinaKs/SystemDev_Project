## Questions and Discussion
* What specific business problem of yours made you consider working with us:
    * what was wrong with the way you were operating before?

    <br><br>
* What is your best description of the industry that you work in?
    <br>*The idea is that it is all hand made. <br>Any idea that a customer may have can be created.* <br><br>

* is your business profitable enough to be your only source of income?<br>
*She does not give enough time to the business, therefore, for now, it is not. But she does not know if she were to be giving her full time attention to it it might be. Right now she has a job, is a student and has this side business so she has no time to test that theory out.*  <br><br>
* Product you sell the most?<br> *Clutch purse* <br><br>
* How do you operate your business?:
    * how are your transactions made?<br> *cash or etransfers* <br><br>

        * in the past 6 months have your sales increased or decreased? <br> *with time, it increases* <br><br>
    * how and where do you get your supplies <br> *Currently is unable to find supplies - is thinking about making it herself. Before, she would buy items from all over syria, through her partner. Creatively chooses material based on projects required* <br><br>
* do you know any businesses that are similar to yours?
    * if so are they affecting your business in any way?<br> *There are a lot of accessory sellers, but no one makes them like her as she really personalizes them* <br><br>
* Have you ever done advertizing? <br> *not yet, soon maybe* <br><br>
    * if adding advertizing through email on website - will it be profitable? <br> *yes, even though it wont be much* <br><br>
